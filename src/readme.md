## Purpose

The purpose of "My Kitchen Hyrules" is to aid players of the game “Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom” with respect to the cooking aspect of the game. 

The existing recipe browsing features in the game are quite limited and not easily searchable, so this web application is intended to serve as a digital companion by creating a space where players can share their culinary discoveries, search for new recipes, and interact with other community members.

## Functionality/Features

*Need to Have:*

* CRUD Operations for Recipes: Capability for users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete their own recipes.
* User Registration/Login: Secure system for users to register and login, allowing them to add, edit, and delete their own recipes and preventing them from editing other people’s recipes.
* Search Function: Users should be able to search for recipes using keywords, ingredients, or effects.
* Recipe Categories: Basic categories for recipes based on their effects or key ingredients.

*Nice to Have:*

* User Ratings and Reviews: Option for users to rate and review recipes, providing feedback to other users.
* Favourites List: Feature allowing users to bookmark favourite recipes for easy access later.
* Recipe Tags: Additional detailed tagging system for recipes to make search more precise.
* Comment/Discussion System: Option for users to leave comments on recipes and interact with each other.

## Target Audience

The target audience for this application would primarily be players of the Zelda game "Tears of the Kingdom," particularly those interested in the in-game cooking mechanic and community interaction. Additionally, this app will also serve as a demonstration of the Full Stack Web Development skills I have developed over the past year. I intend to continue building on this project well after the assessment is submitted.

## Tech Stack

I plan to use MongoDB for the database, Express.js and Node.js for the backend server, and React for the frontend web client. The application will also incorporate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication.
